# Job Hunt FAQ

# **Did you prefer normal referrals on the portal or having connections share your profile with hiring managers?**

I only ever asked for connections to submit a referral for me, and they chose how they did that, I think by submitting through a portal, if that was available to them.

# **Any tips on applying through job portals? Did aligning your resume with the job description help?**

I only had two resumes, a frontend version and a full stack version. I can’t say whether or not modifying my resume for each job would have helped. My intuition said it was a waste of time; that this was a numbers game. I found ways to apply to jobs very quickly. I used an extension called Simplify.jobs that fills out job applications for you, eliminating a lot (not all) manual work. Eventually I ran the experiment of hiring someone on Upwork to apply for jobs for me, being careful that they did not apply to companies where I was attempting to get a referral. They applied to 1,000 jobs in two months in the spring of 2024, and I only got about 3 interviews from that… cold applying to jobs seemed very low ROI….

The market could have changed by now. Things are always in flux, so gather your own evidence and experience. I had the best results from referrals and from professional recruiters who reached out to me on LinkedIn. It took a little time, but eventually I was able to differentiate between professional, serious recruiters and the ones who work for contracting agencies who just want to fix you at a lowballed hourly rate, and then invariably ghost anyway.

# **Did the career break affect your job search or interviews?**

I took about 3 months off, then began prepping and searching for jobs. The ‘searching for jobs’ period lasted 9 months. During those 9 months I was spending 30-50 hours a week just on searching, prepping, or networking.

Sometimes a recruiter (usually of the lowballing, ghosty variety) would ask about my gap in employment. Intuition said I shouldn’t admit that I’ve been looking for a job for so long, so I said that I took some time to travel and reset, and then I began working on side projects and doing some coursework to level up as an engineer, while I looked for a new role.

Most companies didn’t ask, or seem to care.

# **Can you refer me?**

I’d love to, but I’m very new at my new role, so I don’t feel comfortable doing that yet.

# **Can you review my resume?**

Unfortunately right now I simply am swamped and don’t have time. I am also not a resume expert. 

Resume resources I used:

* Here’s a good [article from Remote Rocketship](https://www.remoterocketship.com/advice/guide/software-engineer/resume). I think they have a resume review service.  
* Here’s another good [article from Pramp](https://www.tryexponent.com/blog/software-engineering-resume-checklist?ref=pramp&\_\_s=ifkwh9usmj2od8vq9zeb\&utm\_source=drip-pramp\&utm\_medium=email\&utm\_campaign=Pramp%20Interest%20Campaign\&utm\_content=Here%27s%20the%20resume%20I%20used%20when%20applying%20to%20software%20engineering%20jobs).

# **Did you interview with companies in the tier 3 to tier 2 to tier 1 sequence? How did this approach affect your interview process and what differences did you notice?**

I interviewed companies in “whoever would give me an interview” sequence, but in an ideal world, that sounds like a good idea. However, since every company has a different interview process, you might not be getting comparable practice… but you would be getting practice at interviewing itself, which is definitely a skill that you get better at (and more comfortable with) the more you do it.

# **Miscellaneous advice**

I plan to write a proper blog post about my job search, but here’s a bucket of random advice for now:

* Yeah, probably don't schedule your dream company first. Get some real interview practice first.
* Don't schedule more than one full loop interview per week. It's too much!
* Get mock interview practice on Pramp, interview.io, etc. And through friends.
* Create structure for yourself. Treat this like a job.  
* Find an accountability partner to practice Leetcode with, practice all other interview types with, debrief with, rant with. Try to meet as often as possible, like every morning\!  
* Spend some time on behavioral questions. Especially a really good intro elevator pitch about yourself.

# **Resources I used a lot of**

* Leetcode (the “blind 75” or “grind 75” is a good place to start)  
* Interview Kickstart  
* Greatfrontend.com  
* FrontendEval.com  
* Pramp  
* Interviewing.io  
* Book: “The 2 Hour Job Search” (about systemetizing your search and networking a lot).

# **Resources I created for myself**

* [Algo/DS interview cheat sheet](https://ericbroberg.me/blog/interview-flow-doc).

# **Types of Interviews I Faced**

* Classic ds/algo.  
* Frontend: React (or “framework of your choice”).  
* Frontend: Vanilla JS.  
* Frontend: JS quiz, JS “gotchas.”  
* Frontend system design.  
* Full stack or backend system design.  
* Take home assignments.   
* Timed assessments.   
*  Behavioral- all kinds.

**Pre-interview checklist for myself.**

* Research interview questions you’re likely to get on Glassdoor and similar sites.  
* Cram. For a few days or a few weeks, depending on the role.  
* The night before:  
  * Sleep well. Don’t cram late into the night.  
* The hour before  
  * Meditate, do some deep breathing.  
  * Queue up any prep material that is relevant. Have it on my desk printed out, for example.  
  * Do some vocal exercises.  
  * Take a cold shower.
