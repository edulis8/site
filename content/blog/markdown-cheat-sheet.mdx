# What's Markdown?

Markdown is a nice, quick and easy method to add style to web text. You have the power to customize a document's appearance. You can format words,
incorporate images, generate lists, etc.

Essentially, Markdown consists of standard text combined with a small number of non-alphabetic symbols, like # or *, to achieve these formatting options.

# Syntax guide

Below is a summary of Markdown syntax that we can use across github or in our personal text files.

## Headers

```mdx
# This is a header one

## This is a header two

#### This is a header four
```

# This is a header one

## This is a header two

#### This is a header four

## Emphasis

```mdx
_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can totally** mix them up_
```

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can totally ** mix them up_

## Lists

### Unordered

```mdx
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

### Ordered

```mdx
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Images

```mdx
![github logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
```

![github logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

## Links

```mdx
http://github.com - automatic!
[github](http://github.com)
```

http://github.com - automatic!
[](http://github.com)

## Blockquotes

```mdx
As Bill Mollison said:

> Though the problems of the world are increasingly complex,
> the solutions remain embarrassingly simple.
```

> Though the problems of the world are increasingly complex,
> the solutions remain embarrassingly simple.

## Inline code

```mdx
I think you should use 
`<details>` element here instead.
```

I think you should use a
`<details>` element here instead.

## Syntax highlighting

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting:

````mdx
```js
function helloWorld(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    console.log({ arg, logo: ðŸŒ´ })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js
function helloWorld(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    console.log({ arg, logo: ðŸŒ´ })
  }
}
```

## Footnotes

```mdx
Here's a footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it. 
And then another footnote[^2]. 

[^1]: My example footnote.
[^2]: My other example footnote.
```

Here's a footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it. 
And then another footnote[^2].

[^1]: My example footnote.
[^2]: My other example footnote.

## Task Lists

```mdx
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```mdx
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.

## Extra Cool Stuff You Can Do With Rehype

From https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/ -- this is rad:

Line numbers and highlighting to draw attention to a particular line of code. This is straight from their page. Keeping it here for my own reference :)

````mdx
```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```
````

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```
